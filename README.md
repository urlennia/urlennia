 <h2>The Dominions of Urlennia</h2>
Urlennia is a sovereign nation of natural, sentient beings living in communal harmony, safeguarded by the preeminence of our constitution. We are devoted to the general welfare of the individual and the sanctity of the family institution, casting away the vestiges of a disgraced history of colonial subjugation and the sword of color prejudice. We embark on a new trajectory, built upon the foundation of love, peace, freedom, truth, and justice. Forever mindful of the trappings of spiritual warfare that burden nations, we stand firm in the faith of spiritual rememberance.
<br><br>
Urlennia is a progressive humanitarian state, built on universal access, fair contributions, lifecycle security, and economic vitality. It ensures that all nationals thrive, businesses innovate, and society remains both resilient and equitable.
